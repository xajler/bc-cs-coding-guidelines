### The order of members in `Class`

* Constants
* ReadOnly Fields
* Fields (If many, it can be moved to the end of `Class`)
* Constructor(s)
* Properties (If many, it can be moved to the end of `Class`, but not those with logic)
* Public Methods
* Protected Methods
* Private Method

------

By Microsoft each of those parts should be ordered alphabetically.

I use order of context value and my own feel.

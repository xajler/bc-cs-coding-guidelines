If there is a named `bool`, be consistent with naming it!

```csharp
// good
bool isInactive;
bool isDeleted;

if (isInactive && isDeleted)
{
	return "Buckle up, Dorothy, because Kansas is going bye-bye!";
}

// weired & bad
bool isActive;
bool isDeleted;

if (!isActive && isDeleted)
{
	return "Huston, we are dazed'n'confused!";
}
```

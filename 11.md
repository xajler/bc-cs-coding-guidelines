Remove any break space(s) in code that are more than one line or they are one line but they have no sense to be applied at first place! 

```csharp
public class Matrix
{
	public Matrix()
	{
		this.Message = "I'm in!";
	} 

	public string Message { get; set; }

	public void Join(Pill pill)
	{
		switch(pill)
		{
			// Stop...






			
			// ... hammer time
			case Pill.Blue:
				this.Message = "Ignorance is a bliss";
				break;
			case Pill.Red
			    this.Message = "Buckle up, Dorothy, because Kansas is going bye-bye";
			    break;
			default:
				this.Message = "Holy Trinity! Zyon, we have a problem! [Deja-vu]";
		}

	}
}
```
